**This project differs fundamentally from VITS, as it focuses on Singing Voice Conversion (SVC) rather than Text-to-Speech (TTS). In this project, TTS functionality is not supported, and VITS is incapable of performing SVC tasks. It's important to note that the models used in these two projects are not interchangeable or universally applicable.**

## Announcement

The purpose of this project was to enable developers to have their beloved anime characters perform singing tasks. The developers' intention was to focus solely on fictional characters and avoid any involvement of real individuals, anything related to real individuals deviates from the developer's original intention.

## üìù Model Introduction

The singing voice conversion model uses SoftVC content encoder to extract speech features from the source audio. These feature vectors are directly fed into VITS without the need for conversion to a text-based intermediate representation. As a result, the pitch and intonations of the original audio are preserved. Meanwhile, the vocoder was replaced with [NSF HiFiGAN](https://github.com/openvpi/DiffSinger/tree/refactor/modules/nsf_hifigan) to solve the problem of sound interruption.

### üÜï 4.1-Stable Version Update Content

- Feature input is changed to the 12th Layer of [Content Vec](https://github.com/auspicious3000/contentvec) Transformer output, And compatible with 4.0 branches.
- Update the shallow diffusion, you can use the shallow diffusion model to improve the sound quality.
- Added Whisper-PPG encoder support
- Added static/dynamic sound fusion
- Added loudness embedding
- Added Functionality of feature retrieval from [RVC](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI)
  
### üÜï Questions about compatibility with the 4.0 model

- To support the 4.0 model and incorporate the speech encoder, you can make modifications to the `config.json` file. Add the `speech_encoder` field to the "model" section as shown below:

```
  "model": {
    .........
    "ssl_dim": 256,
    "n_speakers": 200,
    "speech_encoder":"vec256l9"
  }
```

### üÜï Shallow diffusion

## üìä Dataset Preparation

Simply place the dataset in the `dataset_raw` directory with the following file structure:

```
dataset_raw
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄspeaker0
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄxxx1-xxx1.wav
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ...
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄLxx-0xx8.wav
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄspeaker1
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄxx2-0xxx2.wav
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ...
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄxxx7-xxx007.wav
```
There are no specific restrictions on the format of the name for each audio file (naming conventions such as `000001.wav` to `999999.wav` are also valid), but the file type must be `WAV``.

You can customize the speaker's name as showed below:

```
dataset_raw
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄsuijiSUI
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ1.wav
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ...
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ25788785-20221210-200143-856_01_(Vocals)_0_0.wav
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Preprocessing

### 0. Slice audio

To avoid video memory overflow during training or pre-processing, it is recommended to limit the length of audio clips. Cutting the audio to a length of "5s - 15s" is more recommended. Slightly longer times are acceptable, however, excessively long clips may cause problems such as `torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError`.

To facilitate the slicing process, you can use [audio-slicer-GUI](https://github.com/flutydeer/audio-slicer) or [audio-slicer-CLI](https://github.com/openvpi/audio-slicer)

In general, only the `Minimum Interval` needs to be adjusted. For spoken audio, the default value usually suffices, while for singing audio, it can be adjusted to around `100` or even `50`, depending on the specific requirements.

After slicing, it is recommended to remove any audio clips that are excessively long or too short.

**If you are using whisper-ppg encoder for training, the audio clips must shorter than 30s.**

### 1. Resample to 44100Hz and mono

```shell
python resample.py
```

#### Cautions

Although this project has resample.py scripts for resampling, mono and loudness matching, the default loudness matching is to match to 0db. This can cause damage to the sound quality. While python's loudness matching package pyloudnorm does not limit the level, this can lead to sonic boom. Therefore, it is recommended to consider using professional sound processing software, such as `adobe audition` for loudness matching. If you are already using other software for loudness matching, add the parameter `-skip_loudnorm` to the run command:

```shell
python resample.py --skip_loudnorm
```

### 2. Automatically split the dataset into training and validation sets, and generate configuration files.

```shell
python preprocess_flist_config.py --speech_encoder vec768l12
```

speech_encoder has the following options

```
vec768l12
vec256l9
hubertsoft
whisper-ppg
cnhubertlarge
dphubert
whisper-ppg-large
wavlmbase+
```

If the speech_encoder argument is omitted, the default value is `vec768l12`

**Use loudness embedding**

Add `--vol_aug` if you want to enable loudness embedding:

```shell
python preprocess_flist_config.py --speech_encoder vec768l12 --vol_aug
```

After enabling loudness embedding, the trained model will match the loudness of the input source; otherwise, it will match the loudness of the training set.

#### You can modify some parameters in the generated config.json and diffusion.yaml

* `keep_ckpts`: Keep the the the number of previous models during training. Set to `0` to keep them all. Default is `3`.

* `all_in_mem`: Load all dataset to RAM. It can be enabled when the disk IO of some platforms is too low and the system memory is **much larger** than your dataset.
  
* `batch_size`: The amount of data loaded to the GPU for a single training session can be adjusted to a size lower than the GPU memory capacity.

* `vocoder_name`: Select a vocoder. The default is `nsf-hifigan`.

##### diffusion.yaml

* `cache_all_data`: Load all dataset to RAM. It can be enabled when the disk IO of some platforms is too low and the system memory is **much larger** than your dataset.

* `duration`: The duration of the audio slicing during training, can be adjusted according to the size of the video memory, **Note: this value must be less than the minimum time of the audio in the training set!**

* `batch_size`: The amount of data loaded to the GPU for a single training session can be adjusted to a size lower than the video memory capacity.

* `timesteps`: The total number of steps in the diffusion model, which defaults to 1000.

* `k_step_max`: Training can only train `k_step_max` step diffusion to save training time, note that the value must be less than `timesteps`, 0 is to train the entire diffusion model, **Note: if you do not train the entire diffusion model will not be able to use only_diffusion!**

##### **List of Vocoders**

```
nsf-hifigan
nsf-snake-hifigan
```

### 3. Generate hubert and f0

```shell
python preprocess_hubert_f0.py --f0_predictor dio
```

f0_predictor has the following options

```
crepe
dio
pm
harvest
rmvpe
fcpe
```

If the training set is too noisy,it is recommended to use `crepe` to handle f0

If the f0_predictor parameter is omitted, the default value is `rmvpe`

If you want shallow diffusion (optional), you need to add the `--use_diff` parameter, for example:

```shell
python preprocess_hubert_f0.py --f0_predictor dio --use_diff
```

**Speed Up preprocess**

If your dataset is pretty large,you can increase the param `--num_processes` like that:

```shell
python preprocess_hubert_f0.py --f0_predictor dio --num_processes 8
```
All the worker will be assigned to different GPU if you have more than one GPUs.

After completing the above steps, the dataset directory will contain the preprocessed data, and the dataset_raw folder can be deleted.

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç Training

### Sovits Model

```shell
python train.py -c configs/config.json -m 44k
```

Here is a method that allows you to pause training and save the model at any time. Simply create a `stop.txt` file in the running directory, and the training will stop and save the model after the next step.

### Diffusion Model (optional)

If the shallow diffusion function is needed, the diffusion model needs to be trained. The diffusion model training method is as follows:

```shell
python train_diff.py -c configs/diffusion.yaml
```

During training, the model files will be saved to `logs/44k`, and the diffusion model will be saved to `logs/44k/diffusion`

## ü§ñ Inference

Use [inference_main.py](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/inference_main.py)

```shell
# Example
python inference_main.py -m "logs/44k/G_30400.pth" -c "configs/config.json" -n "Âêõ„ÅÆÁü•„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑÁâ©Ë™û-src.wav" -t 0 -s "nen"
```

Required parameters:
- `-m` | `--model_path`: path to the model.
- `-c` | `--config_path`: path to the configuration file.
- `-n` | `--clean_names`: a list of wav file names located in the `raw` folder.
- `-t` | `--trans`: pitch shift, supports positive and negative (semitone) values.
- `-s` | `--spk_list`: Select the speaker ID to use for conversion.
- `-cl` | `--clip`: Forced audio clipping, set to 0 to disable(default), setting it to a non-zero value (duration in seconds) to enable.

Optional parameters: see the next section
- `-lg` | `--linear_gradient`: The cross fade length of two audio slices in seconds. If there is a discontinuous voice after forced slicing, you can adjust this value. Otherwise, it is recommended to use the default value of 0.
- `-f0p` | `--f0_predictor`: Select a F0 predictor, options are `crepe`, `pm`, `dio`, `harvest`, `rmvpe`,`fcpe`, default value is `pm`(note: f0 mean pooling will be enable when using `crepe`)
- `-a` | `--auto_predict_f0`: automatic pitch prediction, do not enable this when converting singing voices as it can cause serious pitch issues.
- `-cm` | `--cluster_model_path`: Cluster model or feature retrieval index path, if left blank, it will be automatically set as the default path of these models. If there is no training cluster or feature retrieval, fill in at will.
- `-cr` | `--cluster_infer_ratio`: The proportion of clustering scheme or feature retrieval ranges from 0 to 1. If there is no training clustering model or feature retrieval, the default is 0.
- `-eh` | `--enhance`: Whether to use NSF_HIFIGAN enhancer, this option has certain effect on sound quality enhancement for some models with few training sets, but has negative effect on well-trained models, so it is disabled by default.
- `-shd` | `--shallow_diffusion`: Whether to use shallow diffusion, which can solve some electrical sound problems after use. This option is disabled by default. When this option is enabled, NSF_HIFIGAN enhancer will be disabled
- `-usm` | `--use_spk_mix`: whether to use dynamic voice fusion
- `-lea` | `--loudness_envelope_adjustment`ÔºöThe adjustment of the input source's loudness envelope in relation to the fusion ratio of the output loudness envelope. The closer to 1, the more the output loudness envelope is used
- `-fr` | `--feature_retrieval`ÔºöWhether to use feature retrieval If clustering model is used, it will be disabled, and `cm` and `cr` parameters will become the index path and mixing ratio of feature retrieval
  
Shallow diffusion settings:
- `-dm` | `--diffusion_model_path`: Diffusion model path
- `-dc` | `--diffusion_config_path`: Diffusion config file path
- `-ks` | `--k_step`: The larger the number of k_steps, the closer it is to the result of the diffusion model. The default is 100
- `-od` | `--only_diffusion`: Whether to use Only diffusion mode, which does not load the sovits model to only use diffusion model inference
- `-se` | `--second_encoding`Ôºöwhich involves applying an additional encoding to the original audio before shallow diffusion. This option can yield varying results - sometimes positive and sometimes negative.

### Cautions

If inferencing using `whisper-ppg` speech encoder, you need to set `--clip` to 25 and `-lg` to 1. Otherwise it will fail to infer properly.

## ü§î Optional Settings

If you are satisfied with the previous results, or if you do not feel you understand what follows, you can skip it and it will have no effect on the use of the model. The impact of these optional settings mentioned is relatively small, and while they may have some impact on specific datasets, in most cases the difference may not be significant.

### Automatic f0 prediction

During the training of the 4.0 model, an f0 predictor is also trained, which enables automatic pitch prediction during voice conversion. However, if the results are not satisfactory, manual pitch prediction can be used instead. Please note that when converting singing voices, it is advised not to enable this feature as it may cause significant pitch shifting.

- Set `auto_predict_f0` to `true` in `inference_main.py`.

### Cluster-based timbre leakage control

Introduction: The clustering scheme implemented in this model aims to reduce timbre leakage and enhance the similarity of the trained model to the target's timbre, although the effect may not be very pronounced. However, relying solely on clustering can reduce the model's clarity and make it sound less distinct. Therefore, a fusion method is adopted in this model to control the balance between the clustering and non-clustering approaches. This allows manual adjustment of the trade-off between "sounding like the target's timbre" and "have clear enunciation" to find an optimal balance.

No changes are required in the existing steps. Simply train an additional clustering model, which incurs relatively low training costs.

- Training process:
  - Train on a machine with good CPU performance. According to extant experience, it takes about 4 minutes to train each speaker on a Tencent Cloud machine with 6-core CPU.
  - Execute `python cluster/train_cluster.py`. The output model will be saved in `logs/44k/kmeans_10000.pt`.
  - The clustering model can currently be trained using the gpu by executing `python cluster/train_cluster.py --gpu`
- Inference process:
  - Specify `cluster_model_path` in `inference_main.py`. If not specified, the default is `logs/44k/kmeans_10000.pt`.
  - Specify `cluster_infer_ratio` in `inference_main.py`, where `0` means not using clustering at all, `1` means only using clustering, and usually `0.5` is sufficient.

### Feature retrieval

Introduction: As with the clustering scheme, the timbre leakage can be reduced, the enunciation is slightly better than clustering, but it will reduce the inference speed. By employing the fusion method, it becomes possible to linearly control the balance between feature retrieval and non-feature retrieval, allowing for fine-tuning of the desired proportion.

- Training process: 
  First, it needs to be executed after generating hubert and f0: 

```shell
python train_index.py -c configs/config.json
```

The output of the model will be in `logs/44k/feature_and_index.pkl`

- Inference process: 
  - The `--feature_retrieval` needs to be formulated first, and the clustering mode automatically switches to the feature retrieval mode.
  - Specify `cluster_model_path` in `inference_main.py`. If not specified, the default is `logs/44k/feature_and_index.pkl`.
  - Specify `cluster_infer_ratio` in `inference_main.py`, where `0` means not using feature retrieval at all, `1` means only using feature retrieval, and usually `0.5` is sufficient.

## üóúÔ∏è Model compression

The generated model contains data that is needed for further training. If you confirm that the model is final and not be used in further training, it is safe to remove these data to get smaller file size (about 1/3).

```shell
# Example
python compress_model.py -c="configs/config.json" -i="logs/44k/G_30400.pth" -o="logs/44k/release.pth"
```

## üë®‚Äçüîß Timbre mixing

### Static Tone Mixing

**Refer to `webUI.py` file for stable Timbre mixing of the gadget/lab feature.**

Introduction: This function can combine multiple models into one model (convex combination or linear combination of multiple model parameters) to create mixed voice that do not exist in reality

**Note:**
1. This feature is only supported for single-speaker models
2. If you force a multi-speaker model, it is critical to make sure there are the same number of speakers in each model. This will ensure that sounds with the same SpeakerID can be mixed correctly.
3. Ensure that the `model` fields in config.json of all models to be mixed are the same
4. The mixed model can use any config.json file from the models being synthesized. However, the clustering model will not be functional after mixed.
5. When batch uploading models, it is best to put the models into a folder and upload them together after selecting them
6. It is suggested to adjust the mixing ratio between 0 and 100, or to other numbers, but unknown effects will occur in the linear combination mode
7. After mixing, the file named output.pth will be saved in the root directory of the project
8. Convex combination mode will perform Softmax to add the mix ratio to 1, while linear combination mode will not

### Dynamic timbre mixing

**Refer to the `spkmix.py` file for an introduction to dynamic timbre mixing**

Character mix track writing rules:

Role ID: \[\[Start time 1, end time 1, start value 1, start value 1], [Start time 2, end time 2, start value 2]]

The start time must be the same as the end time of the previous one. The first start time must be 0, and the last end time must be 1 (time ranges from 0 to 1).

All roles must be filled in. For unused roles, fill \[\[0., 1., 0., 0.]]

The fusion value can be filled in arbitrarily, and the linear change from the start value to the end value within the specified period of time. The 

internal linear combination will be automatically guaranteed to be 1 (convex combination condition), so it can be used safely

Use the `--use_spk_mix` parameter when reasoning to enable dynamic timbre mixing

## üì§ Exporting to Onnx

Use [onnx_export.py](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/onnx_export.py)

- Create a folder named `checkpoints` and open it
- Create a folder in the `checkpoints` folder as your project folder, naming it after your project, for example `aziplayer`
- Rename your model as `model.pth`, the configuration file as `config.json`, and place them in the `aziplayer` folder you just created
- Modify `"NyaruTaffy"` in `path = "NyaruTaffy"` in [onnx_export.py](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/onnx_export.py) to your project name, `path = "aziplayer"`Ôºàonnx_export_speaker_mix makes you can mix speaker's voiceÔºâ
- Run [onnx_export.py](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/onnx_export.py)
- Wait for it to finish running. A `model.onnx` will be generated in your project folder, which is the exported model.

Note: For Hubert Onnx models, please use the models provided by MoeSS. Currently, they cannot be exported on their own (Hubert in fairseq has many unsupported operators and things involving constants that can cause errors or result in problems with the input/output shape and results when exported.)
